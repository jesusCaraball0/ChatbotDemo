https://dtaconnect.eohhs.mass.gov/ 
Eligibility:
To be eligible, an individual must: 
Have children 18 or younger,  
Are pregnant and are due in less than 4 months; if you are under age 20 you may be eligible at any stage of pregnancy, and/or
Are a caregiver for a child you are related to but who is not your biological or adopted child. As a caregiver, you can apply for TAFDC for yourself and the child(ren) or only the child(ren) in your care. If you apply only for the child(ren) DTA will not look at your income when you apply, even though the application is in your name. If the child in your case has income, that may affect eligibility.
You live in Massachusetts,
You or someone in your family are a U.S. citizen or an eligible immigrant, and
Your income is below the TAFDC limits. Your family's gross income must be under the income limit. (Gross income is the amount before things like taxes are taken out.) 
The income limit is based on your family size and the type of housing you live in.
There are different rules if you are a teen parent under age 18 living with your parent(s).
How do I know if my family’s income is below the TAFDC limit?
Add up all income before taxes or other deductions. Do not count income of a foster child or someone who gets SSI. 
If you are working, subtract $200 from your monthly gross earnings. Then, if you got TAFDC in the last 4 months, subtract half of the rest of your gross earnings. These are deductions. 
If you pay for child care, tell DTA during your application interview. We may be able to subtract more of your earnings.

Child Support rules for TAFDC: Every child who gets TAFDC must have a child support case unless they live with both parents. But, you may not have to apply for child support for a child if you have experienced domestic violence or have safety concerns.  Tell us if you are worried about this.

If you do not already have a child support order, DTA will connect you to the Department of Revenue (DOR). DOR can help you establish paternity and get a child support order.

The state of Massachusetts must keep any child support paid for children who get TAFDC. If a child’s parent (who does not live with the child) pays child support while you get TAFDC, you will get the first $50 each month. This is in addition to TAFDC.

Can DTA help connect me to employment and training services?

DTA will connect all applicants over 18 who can work to JobQuest - the online system connecting people to the MassHire Career Center network. Some applicants must register as part of their TAFDC application.

You can register now for access to free tools and resources to support your career pathway. DTA can also help you register after you apply. Learn more and register here.

Disability accommodation: If you have a disability or health problem that makes it hard for you to do something DTA asks, you can ask for help. This is called an accommodation. If you need assistance, you can contact your case manager or call the DTA Assistance line to be connected to a Client Assistance Coordinator.

Safety concerns or other issues because of domestic violence: If you are dealing with the impacts of domestic violence, DTA can help. The Domestic Violence (DV) Unit can help address safety concerns and other impacts of domestic violence. Find your local DV specialist. If it is an emergency or after hours, call SAFELINK at (877) 785‐2020.

Limitations:
For most families, benefits are only available for 24 out of every 60 months (i.e. 2 out of 5 years), but there are exceptions to the rule for some recipients. The adult recipient of TAFDC can be working and still receive these benefits.

Immigrants: Many immigrants who legally entered the country after 8/22/96 face a five year wait before becoming eligible (but not veterans, refugees, asylees and some others).

WIC is only usable for certain approved nutritious foods, unlike like SNAP benefits. Recipients receive a list of foods and participating retailers at enrollment.
WIC is a short-term program. Therefore, a participant will "graduate" at the end of one or more certification periods. A certification period is the length of time a WIC participant is eligible to receive benefits. An eligible individual usually receives WIC benefits from 6 months to a year, at which time she/he must reapply.

Birth certificate

WIC participants receive an EBT card to purchase specific foods each month that are designed to supplement their diets with specific nutrients. There is no maximum dollar amount per month, but rather a max “barcode” amount. This means that a family can scan and buy a max amount of certain foods (every item has a barcode) per month.

Program Name: Medicare
Agency: United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
Description: Medicare is health insurance for people 65 or older. You may be eligible to get Medicare earlier if you have a disability, End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), or ALS (also called Lou Gehrig’s disease). 
Some people get Medicare automatically, others have to actively sign up -- it depends if you start getting retirement or disability benefits from Social Security before you turn 65. 
It is divided into parts: Medicare Part A provides hospitalization coverage; Part B provides outpatient coverage (doctors visits, etc.) and Part D provides prescription drug coverage. Part C lets private companies do all of the above for an extra fee.
Website: www.medicare.gov 
Eligibility:
Eligible if 65 or over, have end-stage renal disease or ALS (regardless of age), or have been disabled & receiving SSDI for more than 24 months.
Limitations:
Part A (hospital coverage) is automatic enrollment at 65, but people must choose to enroll in Part B (doctor’s visit coverage) and pay a premium which rises most years with inflation. Part B average cost: $109/month for SS recipients paying the premium through SS benefits; $134/month for individuals earning $85,000 or less; or couples earning $170,000 or less. For those earning more, payment amounts increase up to a maximum of $428.50/month. The longer a person over 65 waits to sign up for Medicare, the greater the premiums they will have to pay for Parts B and D.
Immigrants: “Lawfully present” immigrants with 40 quarters of work history qualify. Those who have been in the country 5+ years but have not worked long enough can purchase coverage.

Amount:
Part B has a yearly deductible of $183. After deductible is met, recipient pays 20% of Medicare-approved amount for services. Part D has an initial deductible of $400. After this, Medicare will pay cost of prescriptions until total reaches $3700. Between $3700 and $4950, there is a coverage gap or “donut hole,” where Medicare no longer pays full cost. While in the gap, recipient pays ~40% of price for brand name drugs and ~50% for generics, until total reaches $4950 when full coverage resumes.
How to Apply:
People who have chosen to receive Social Security at 65 or have been on SSDI for 24 months are automatically enrolled in Medicare at that point and will be mailed a members card for Part A coverage. Those with end-stage renal disease or ALS, or not receiving Social Security yet, must request a card.
For more information, call 1-800-633-4227.
Linked Services? None directly.
Right to appeal? Extensive and complex system of appeals, consisting of five levels, if denied payment/coverage for Medicare-related health services. Unclear if there is a time limit for appeal. Medicare’s website does not address issue of appealing denial of initial application for Medicare.
Retroactive? Not in general or useful way. Some disabled may see Medicare retroactively pay for some services previously paid by MassHealth.

Amount:
Child care coverage varies by income, household size and age of child, but there is no maximum cap. Co-pays are based on a sliding scale: families in Tier Level 1 income bracket (=family of 2 earning up to $971/month) pay $0. Fees rise in multiple increments up to $205/week for a family earning 85% SMI or 100% SMI income if child has disability.

Right to appeal? Yes, through EEC or DTA, depending on type of voucher. The Resource & Referral Agency will provide an appeal form asking for supportive documentation.

Websites: www.socialsecurity.gov/disability & www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/10029.html
Eligibility:
An individual is eligible if he/she worked enough “quarters of years” (generally 40, but depends on age) to qualify for Social Security in general; and worked at least half time in the recent past until quarter of year that he/she became disabled (ex: 1.5 years/3 years if under 24; 5 years/10 if over 31; if age 24-31, must have worked half time during those years).
Availability/Limitations:
Social Security is granted based on: 1) If individual is working, determining earnings 2) Asking doctor to determine severity of disability 3) Seeing if disability appears on the official SS “List of Impairments” 4) Deciding if disability prevents individual from returning to old line of work, or if he/she cannot do other work, given impairment, age, education, work experience and skills.

Program Name: Social Security
Agency: United States Social Security
Description: A federal benefit primarily meant for those 65+ (“retirees”) and their spouses, including divorced or widowed, but also extended to some disabled adults and surviving children of deceased parents.
Website: www.ssa.gov
Eligibility:
People with a work history of “40 quarters” (=10 full years) can apply for Social Security as early as age 62, but will receive considerably less money monthly than if they apply at or after age 66. Children under 18 (19 if in high school) of retirees/deceased parents eligible for Social Security will receive a monthly check also.
Availability/Limitations:
This is a universal program, available to any citizen/legal immigrant with the documented work history. It is not “means tested,” meaning it does not have income limits for eligibility. It continues from date of eligibility/application until death.
The age at which a “retiree” receives full benefits has been slowly increasing in the past few years. Now, a person has to be 66 in order to qualify for the full amount, not 65 as in the past. The age limit will not increase again until 2020, and then it will slowly rise to age 67 (for those born in 1960 or later).
Note: Not all workers are covered by Social Security. Railroad workers, some state government workers, and federal government workers all have separate pension systems that do not necessarily contain the same rights or benefit levels as Social Security.
Note: Spouses (including ex-spouses & widow(er)s and ones who did not have enough work quarters on their own) can receive up to their spouse’s Social Security amount, even if their own Social Security benefit would be less or non-existent.
Immigrants: Eligible if legal to work and meet above standards.
Amount:
Maximum is $2,542/month at 65, average is $1,360 (2016). The longer an individual puts off receiving benefits, the higher the monthly payment thereafter. Payment to seniors continues until death, payments to disabled continue until no longer disabled, and payments to children end at 19.
How to Apply:
Visit local Social Security Office, find via secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp
Boston Social Security Office - Room 148, 10 Causeway Street, Boston, MA 02222
Apply via Phone: 1-800-772-1213 or TDD: 1-800-325-0778
If any other income sources exist, it is not wise to start Social Security before 66. Individual should apply three months before the date he/she wants benefits to start.
Linked Services? Medicare eligibility begins at 65.
Right to appeal? If denied or disagree on amount, must appeal within 60 days of initial decision to have case reconsidered.
Retroactive? Yes, up to 6 months back to date of eligibility.
